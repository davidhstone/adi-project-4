Flash The Cash allows users to input a street address and zipcode and view important information about the congressional district wherein the address lies. The first disctrict detail screen returns the congressional district name, the current congressional rep and their contact info, and the nme of the voting district. Another push of a button reveals the top donor industry of the congressperson, and the topm five donors within that industry.

The app helps to fill knowledge gaps about congressional districts that many politically interestd users find difficult to research, but would often want at hand while engaged in political discussions at hand or while trying to dertermine how to cast their votes in elections that don't generate massive much media attention. 


Explanations of the technologies used:

Flash the cash uses two api calls in order to return its data. The first to usgeocoder.com to return the basic district info, and the second to opensecrets.org which returns donor info.
