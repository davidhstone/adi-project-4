Research for Project 4

RESEARCH PLAN

   Yet To Be Named Current Location Political Influence Info Research Ameliorator

2. Authors -  Dave Stone
   Stakeholders - Users who want to easily get info on the congressional district they're currently in, GA Instructors: Drew Mahrt, Alan Cesares, Charlie Drews

3. Date - 8/24/16

4. Background - There are a lot of people online sharing political opinions that seem to think that they're 
					contributing to a common good by sharing their opinions. 
					A couple criticisms of them, often self-directed, are: 
						a) they often get their facts wrong
						b) they often comment about the goings on in areas they don't know much about
						c) they either lack the time to do research, or they don't know how to do research
					In the internet and smartphone age, people are said to have the ability to access a broad swath of human knowledge, with a couple simple search terms input into their browsers. Even so, the ability to synthsize data resulting from a few seperate searches into a new context seems to often be inhibitory. People want to talk about and apply their political opinions, but those opinions aren't worth much if they're not based in facts. There's seems to be a lack of knowledge in these debates about details; although people seem to have opinions on their local politics, it seems that most people know only the name and party affilition of their local congressional reps, and know nothing about the reps of other districs. There also seems to be growing common belief that party affiliation matters less than who it is that's putting a rep in office in terms of campaign contributions and lobbies. If there were a simple app that related a district's current rep to their top campaign contributors and/or local lobbying muscle, it would likely lessen the need to do research and contribute to the quality of info people are sharing online, and is affecting their choices of how to cast their votes and spend their money.

5. Goals - to determine what info about a congressional district users would like to easily look up

6. Research Questions - What info would users like to easily look up about congressinoal districts?
						What are users thoughts on the influence of campaign money on congressional politics?
						Can users easily look up info about their and others' representatives?
						Do users think that widespread knowledge of sources of campaign money could effect "change"? 

7. Methodology - User research through surveys and interviews

8. Participants - Politically curious app users
				  have thought about the influence of campaign money in politics at a district level
				  don't have time to research info about districts
				  interested in sharing info with other	

9. Schedule - Recruiting begins: 8/24
			  Study Day: 8/25
			  Results Delivery: 8/26

10. Script - 1. Knowledge of one's own district:
					Do users know who their congressional representatives are and who's funding them? 
			 2. Lack of knowledge about one's district 
			 		What are blockers to knowing one's rep and who's funding them?
			 3. Knowledge about districts traveled to
			 		Do users know who the reps are, and who's funding them, in the districts they travel to?
			 4. Lack of knowledge about disctricts traveled to
			 		What are blockers to knowing others' reps and who's funding them?
			 5. Curiousity about one's own and other districts
			 		If it could happen with the push of a button, would users want to know who's funding representatives of their own and other districts?
